# fake_or_real_news

In this project i used a dataset from Kaggle which you can reach here:

https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Added new columns to fake and real datasets named 'Real', which indicates the news are rea or not. If real it is 1, if not it is 0.
After that, i joined fake and real datasets and split them into train and test sets. Finally i used decision tree classifier to decide news whether real or not which has %98 accuracy.
